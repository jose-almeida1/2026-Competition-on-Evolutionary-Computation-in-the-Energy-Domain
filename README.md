## Competition Outline

Following the success of the previous editions at IEEE PES-GM, CEC, GECCO, and WCCI, we are launching another challenging edition of the competition at major conferences in the field of computational intelligence and power systems. This WCCI and GECCO 2026 competition challenges participants to develop benchmark evolutionary algorithms for optimizing energy pricing strategies in Local Energy Communities (LECs). Unlike traditional methods focused solely on cost minimization, this competition emphasizes fairness-aware pricing, where fairness metrics (e.g., Jain’s Fairness index, standard deviation of energy bills, Quality of Experience) guide the optimization process. The goal is to promote the design of metaheuristic algorithms that produce pricing strategies balancing technical efficiency and equitable cost distribution among community members.

Note: The track is developed to run under the same framework as past competitions.

## Competition Goals

The competition has been held since 2017 at major conferences (the first competition was launched at IEEE PES GM) – Website: http://www.gecad.isep.ipp.pt/smartgridcompetitions.

We have been implementing variants of the benchmark problems, but have always used the same framework. This year, we implemented a novel framework for fairness-aware pricing optimization in energy communities (a relatively recent problem in the energy domain), using an evaluation criterion that includes the fitness value and the number of function evaluations (e.g., convergence).

## Rules

- Participants will propose and implement metaheuristic algorithms (e.g., evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, estimation of distribution algorithm, etc.) to solve the proposed track problem in the energy domain.
- The organizers provide a framework, implemented in MATALAB© 2021a 64 bits, in which participants can easily test their algorithms (we also provide a hybrid-adaptive differential evolution algorithm implementation as an example). The guidelines include the necessary information to understand the problem, how the solutions are represented, and how the fitness function is evaluated. Also, we provide information on mathematical formulation regarding the objective function value and problem constraints. Those elements are common for all participants.
- A maximum number of “function evaluations” is considered for all algorithms. However, this year, the algorithms’ convergence properties, measured as the number of “functions evaluations”, are part of the evaluation criteria in the competition. Thus, participants should strive to obtain the lowest number of “function evaluations” as well.
In addition, 20 independent trials should be performed in the framework by each participant.
